An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. In simple words, it is a hashmap like data structure that directs you from a word to a document or a web page.

Inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database.
It is easy to develop.
It is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems, used on a large scale for example in search engines.
